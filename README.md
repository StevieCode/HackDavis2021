## Inspiration
Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we thought that a lot of people had lost their daily routine which allowed them to live a healthy lifestyle. Our objective was to create an app that would encourage users to achieve their daily goals of adequate water, sleep, and exercise ( The 3 essential components of a healthy lifestyle we thought were applicable to all users ). By introducing a support network into our app, friends and family could support each other and embark on the journey towards a healthy lifestyle together! 

## What it does
What The Health allows users to set their daily goal for water, sleep, and exercise. They are also given the ability to track their progress towards these daily goals. Users are able to add their friends and family, which allows them to monitor their progress as well as send them encouraging messages to keep up their progress.

## How I built it
Our mobile application was built using React-Native, Expo, Javascript, and Firebase. The front end of our application was created using React-Native, with Javascript handling the logic. In addition, we created a lot of custom images using ProCreate to help with the design of our front end. Firebase was used for user authentication and storing user data which was crucial in allowing us to introduce the network aspect of our application.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we had were dependency issues and managing our Github repo. Also at first, we had some issues getting Firebase correctly set up to store User Data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were pleased that we were able to complete what we had planned for the app in terms of functionality by the due date. We are also really proud of the drawings that we incorporated into the UI, we feel that they give our app a unique and creative appearance. We were really happy that one of our members was able to further his pre exisiting knowledge of Firebase and help us incooperate it into our application which was really useful for the network aspect.

## What we learned
We learned many aspects of being a Software Engineer. One of our members was completely new to mobile app development so for him he was able to learn from the other team members and get familiar with React-Native. In addition one of our members was able to really strengthen his firebase foundation through this experience.

## What's next for What The Health
The support network was a large part of our application we wanted to emphasize, however, we were limited to the standard Expo & React-Native SDK due to time constraints. In the future, we would like to integrate the Twilio API to further flesh out the capabilities of our support network. (+ more ideas)
