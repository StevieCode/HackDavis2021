# HackDavis2021 - What The Health
---

## What it does
What The Health allows users to set their daily goal for water, sleep, and exercise. 
They are also given the ability to track their progress towards these daily goals. 
Users are able to add their friends and family, which allows them to monitor their progress as well as send them encouraging messages to keep up their progress.

## Tools used
Our mobile application was built using React-Native, Expo, Javascript, and Firebase. 
The front end of our application was created using React-Native, with Javascript handling the logic. 
In addition, we created a lot of custom images using ProCreate to help with the design of our front end. 
Firebase was used for user authentication and storing user data for the network aspect of our application.
